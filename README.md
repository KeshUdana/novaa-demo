**1. Fork the project:**

- Click the gray <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your GitHub account.

**2. Create a New Branch:**

- On your new repository's page, click the gray main button in the upper left to reveal a dropdown menu.

- Enter the name of your new branch in the text box. (Branch names usually refer to what is being changed. Follow this format if you can. Example: `achintha-ekanayake`, `keshawa-udana`).

- Click on Create branch, which will automatically take you to your new branch. You can make edits on the main branch, but this may cause issues down the line. The best practice is to create a new branch for each separate issue you work on. That way your main branch remains in sync with this repo's main branch.

**3. Clone:**

- Clone this new branch to your computer. Open it with your preferred editor.

  - To obtain a cloning link you can click the green button named `<> code` on the top right of your repository main page and copy the path or simply download the `zip` file.
  - In case of cloning, simply run:

  ```cmd
  git clone <path>
  ```

- But before you start editing, remember to <b>install</b> the required npm packages.

- make sure you are in the root folder of the respective project and run:

  ```cmd
  npm install
  ```

**4. Edit:**

- <b>Only make changes to the folder under your name</b>. And create/design your own profile pages. Feel free to delete the boilerplate code on your respective pages. Make your profiles as much as personalized as you want.

- Make sure to check your added changes in the development server by running:

  ```cmd
  npm run dev
  ```

- By default the page is hosted on `localhost:3000`

**5. Raise a Pull Request:**

- Click `Pull Requests` option in your forked repository (which is the third option at the top of this page after the options `Code` and `Issues`).

- Click the green New Pull Request button. This will prep the new pull request for you by auto-filling the base repository: base with 'EddieGitHubCommunity: main' AND auto-filling your head repository: compare with your repository: main

- Click on your head repository's `compare` dropdown, and switch branches from your 'main' branch to `<new branch name>`.

- Finally, click the green `Create Pull Request` button. Great job! You did it!
